How to run code:
Clone the repo to get code and config.

Open the main notebook in Google Colab (or run scripts locally).

Set runtime to Python 3 and GPU if needed.

Install dependencies

Mount Google Drive to persist datasets/models.

Provide API keys securely (do not commit them in code or repo).

Download/prepare datasets into the data/ directory.

Run cells sequentially (recommended: Restart & Run All for reproducibility).

Save checkpoints and outputs to Drive for later use.

Verify with a small sample inference.

Commit code changes (do not push large binaries).

Record commit hash and pinned package versions for reproducibility.
